# toDoApp
JS to-do list app
The app is a simple front-end browser based app, where the user inputs to-do items
in the provided input field, and registers them, either by pressing the enter
button, or by clicking the "add" button.

These items are then shown on the User Interface as a list of items, with "done"
and "delete" buttons.

Clicking on the done button would make the item to become 'crossed out', while
clicking on the delete button would remove the item from the list entirely.
